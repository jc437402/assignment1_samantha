<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Cossie Play Website is intended to increase revenue for Cossie Play by promoting the offers and discounts by the company and increasing new and repeat customers.</p>

<p>We hope that more customers would come to the parties and get costumes made if they knew about us more.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>We would like to get at least more than 30 people to the parties each month and make at least more than 4 costumes per week</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We get cosplayers of all ages, but mostly they are 35 - 50. We want to get more high school kids and young adults to cosplay.</p>
